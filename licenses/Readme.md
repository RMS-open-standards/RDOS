# RDOS Licenses

Mar 24, 2020
## RDOS License Agreement: Apache License 2.0
The Risk Data Open Standard (RDOS) is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](Apache_License), which is a permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.

## RMS Contributor Agreements
Risk Management Solutions (RMS) uses contributor agreements to accept regular contributions from individuals and corporations.
These agreements help us achieve our goal of providing a reliable and long-lived Risk Data Open Standard (RDOS) through collaborative open source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of RDOS while providing RMS and its projects the right to distribute and build upon their work within RMS.

### Contributor License Agreements
- ICLA: [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](RMS-RDOS_IndividualCLA.pdf)
- CCLA: [Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](RMS-RDOS_CorporateCLA.pdf)

RMS desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the RDOS project complete, sign, and submit via email an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](RMS-RDOS_IndividualCLA.pdf).

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to RMS and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to the RDOS project.

For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on the RDOS project, a [Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)](RMS-RDOS_CorporateCLA.pdf) is available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement.

Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.

The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.

The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work address.

Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative Public name. For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles Dickens, but you wish to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter the latter as your Public name. Your Full name should be written with your given name first and your family name last, though your preferred ordering can be used in the Public name.
The email address and other contact details are not published.

### How-to: Submitting License Agreements and Grants
Documents may be submitted by email and signed by hand or by electronic signature. Postal mail hard copy and fax are no longer supported.

When submitting by email, please fill the form with a pdf viewer, then print, sign, scan all pages into a single pdf file, and attach the pdf file to an email to contact@riskdataos.org.

If possible, send the attachment from the email address in the document. Please send only one document per email.

We do not accept Zip files or other archives. We do not accept links to files; the files must be attached to the mail.

Please note that typing your name in the field at the bottom of the document is not signing, regardless of the font that is used. Signing is one of writing your signature by hand on a printed copy of the document, digitally signing the document by hand drawing a signature, signing the document digitally via gpg, or signing the document via DocuSign. Unsigned documents will not be accepted.

From wikipedia.org: A signature is a handwritten (and often stylized) depiction of someone's name or nickname, on documents as a proof of identity and intent.
